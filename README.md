# Task 15: End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow using Scikit-learn Pipeline and ColumnTransformer.

## Steps Performed:
1. Loaded Breast Cancer dataset
2. Separated features and target
3. Applied preprocessing using ColumnTransformer
4. Built ML pipeline with Logistic Regression
5. Trained and evaluated the model
6. Saved trained model using joblib

## Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Google Colab

## Dataset used:
Breast Cancer Dataset (from sklearn)

## Final Outcome

- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline
- Preprocessed data and trained Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Saved trained pipeline for reuse

This task demonstrates a production-style machine learning workflow.
